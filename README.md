# Incremental Techniques based on ML for crop yeild 

## Objective
Agriculture is the backbone of countries like India. However, the usage of technology towards
agriculture is to be given paramount importance towards preclusion agriculture.

Prediction of the crop yield using the efficient algorithm and suggest how much quantity of
fertilizer should be used to get the proper yield for the crop using random forest and back
propagation.
